## Growth & Guidance Session

A while back, I received career advice that made a real difference when I was at a crossroads. There was no secret formula, just a conversation that helped me find clarity and make a decision.

Now, I’d like to pay it forward and offer similar support to those who might need it.

+ Need career advice but don’t have a supportive manager?
+ Trying to navigate work challenges, land your next role, or seeking an outside perspective?
+ Need a mock interview or feedback on your CV?

I’m offering **free one-time sessions** to help. Book a time slot [here](https://calendar.app.google/niQgsQo5onYqXn7H6)
